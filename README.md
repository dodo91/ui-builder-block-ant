# Ant Design UI Builder

A drag-and-drop UI builder inspired by [Blocks](https://github.com/blocks/blocks) that focuses on Ant Design components. The application lets you compose responsive layouts with rows, columns, and forms, tweak component properties, and generate ready-to-use React code.

## Features

- ðŸ“¦ Component palette with curated Ant Design building blocks (layout, form, inputs, content).
- ðŸ§± Nested drag-and-drop canvas with support for rows, columns, forms, and form items.
- ðŸ§® Property inspector for editing component settings (layout, labels, placeholders, etc.).
- ðŸ§¾ Live React/Ant Design code generation reflecting the canvas state.

## Getting started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

The development server runs on [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173).

## Build

```

This produces an optimized production bundle in the `dist` directory.
